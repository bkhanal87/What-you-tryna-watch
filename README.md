## Description ##

## User Story ##
This application allows users to search any movie, read information about the movie, and read user's comments about the movie.

We decided to use React for frontend to give our application a dynamic user interface. Using React, we were able to build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. We decided to use Bootstrap-react ane CSS for styling. We decided to use MongoDB to store our data for greater scalability and to access and query our data for any use case from a unified query API. 

## Features



## Motivation ##
The team wanted to create an application that could help with movie reviews and allow users to give honest opinion on their own views of a movie. Even with the evolution of modern technologies, not very many websites have interactive platforms where users can chat and leave comments about the movies they watched or are planning on watching in the future. 

## Features ##

This application has the following features:
Users can search for a movie by entering the movie's name on the search bar
As the user types the first three letters of the movie, the search bar provides a list of suggestions 
For each searched movie, the application shows the image of the movie in the left hand section and the title of the movie along with rating, release, runtime, and genre in the right hand section. A dropdown with a title story and the story description is also displayed in the right hand section right below the title and the aforementioned information. 
Anyone can search and read the comments, but if you want to post your own, you must create a new account or login to an existing account

We hope to implement the following features in the future:

Enable users to add screenshots,video clips, and images
Add username to comments
Set up account to notify for mentions
Add trailers
Favorite movies


## Challenges ##
We had a very limited amount of time to complete this project. On top of the time crunch, one of the developers we had to work with wasn't able to pitch in due to personal reasons. We had a few merge conflicts. We also spent a significant amount of time deciding what to use for database and while creating autosearch feature and adding a comments section.
